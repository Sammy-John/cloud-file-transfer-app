# 5-Day Project Plan for Cloud-based File Transfer Application

## Day 1: Project Setup and Front-end Development
### Tasks:
- Set up GitHub repository for version control.
- Create the **React** front-end structure.
  - Set up components for file upload form, file history, and transfer progress.
  - Use **CSS** for basic styling and responsiveness.
- Deploy the front-end to **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
  - Set up continuous deployment linked to GitHub.

### Learning Topic: **React and CSS**
- Refresh React component architecture, hooks, and state management.
- Review CSS for responsive layouts and modern design techniques (Flexbox/Grid).
- Optional: Review **Vercel** or **Netlify** deployment processes.

---

## Day 2: Flask Back-end and API Design
### Tasks:
- Set up **Flask** back-end.
  - Create basic API structure for handling file uploads.
  - Connect Flask to a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- Set up routes for:
  - Uploading files.
  - Fetching file history (metadata).
  - Handling errors and exceptions in the API.
- Set up **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** (using ElephantSQL, Heroku Postgres, or MongoDB Atlas).

### Learning Topic: **Flask and RESTful API Design**
- Review how Flask handles routes, requests, and responses.
- Explore best practices for building RESTful APIs with Flask.
- Review Flask database integration with **SQLAlchemy** for Postgres or **PyMongo** for MongoDB.

---

## Day 3: Cloud Integrations (AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox APIs)
### Tasks:
- Integrate **AWS S3** to allow file uploads from the back-end.
  - Set up an S3 bucket, IAM user, and necessary permissions.
  - Implement file upload API in Flask to upload files to S3.
- Add integration for **Google Drive API** and/or **Dropbox API**.
  - Implement file upload and download for Google Drive or Dropbox.
- Create API endpoints for file transfer between cloud storage services.

### Learning Topic: **Cloud Storage APIs (AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox)**
- Review AWS S3 fundamentals, including uploading, permissions, and access control.
- Refresh knowledge of Google Drive API and Dropbox API for file handling.

---

## Day 4: DevOps and Deployment (AWS, Docker, Heroku)
### Tasks:
- Containerize your Flask application using **Docker**.
  - Create a `Dockerfile` for both the back-end and front-end.
  - Test the application locally using Docker.
- Deploy the back-end to **AWS (EC2)** or **Heroku**.
  - Set up environment variables for secure API keys and credentials.
- Set up **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (automated testing and deployment).

### Learning Topic: **DevOps (AWS, Docker, CI/CD)**
- Review Docker fundamentals, including creating and running containers.
- Explore **AWS EC2** or **Heroku** deployment strategies for Flask apps.
- Refresh knowledge on **GitHub Actions** for setting up automated pipelines.

---

## Day 5: Testing, Error Handling, and Documentation
### Tasks:
- Write unit and integration tests for the Flask API using **pytest**.
  - Test file uploads, cloud integrations, and error handling.
- Implement logging and monitoring using **Sentry** or **LogDNA** for the application.
- Write documentation for:
  - API usage (for developers).
  - Application usage (for users).
  - Deployment instructions.
- Final deployment to production (Netlify for front-end, AWS/Heroku for back-end).
- Clean up code, ensure all components are functioning properly, and review.

### Learning Topic: **Testing and Documentation**
- Review testing strategies for Flask applications, including **pytest** and testing APIs.
- Explore best practices for writing clean, user-friendly documentation.
- Refresh how to implement logging and error tracking using Sentry or LogDNA.

## Additional Notes:
- **Daily Learning Time**: Aim to spend 1â€“2 hours reviewing and practicing the learning topic each day before jumping into project tasks.
- **Focus on Simplicity**: Keep the app simple and functional, showcasing key skills in **React, Flask, APIs, Cloud Integrations**, and **DevOps**.
- **Project Documentation**: Regularly update your documentation to ensure clarity, especially for deployment and API usage.
