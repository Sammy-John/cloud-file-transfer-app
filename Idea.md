# Project Idea: Cloud-Based File Transfer Application

**Overview**: Simple, secure, fast file transfer application that allows users to upload and transfer files between different cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)using APis.

## Core Features

1. **Front-End(React + CSS)**
    - Clean UI to select files, cloud services for transfer and track progress
    - React for front-end for smooth and responsive design
    - Drag + Drop Functionality for file uploads

2. **Back-End (Python)**
    - Back-end API using Flask that handles logic for cloud integration(Authenticating Cloud Services, Initiaitng File Transfers)
    - Integrate cloud Storage APIs (AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox) for file uploads and downloads

3. **DevOps:**
    - Deploy on AWS using Docker Containers, showing understanding of DevOps Principles
    - Include setup for CI to automate testing and deployment

4. **Database**
    - Use Postgres or MongoDB for storing file metadata such as file size, user information, and transfer status.
    - Implement a basic system for tracking file transfer history, allowing users to reviw past file movements.

5. **Security and API**
   - Token based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to protect the API endpoints
   - Use APIs to connect to cloud services, ensuring secure data transfer.

6. **Documentation**
    - Clear concise documentation on setup and use the app focusing on simplicity and ease of use.

7. **Bonus Features**
    - **Integration with SFTP** to allow secure transfer files between cloud services and an SFTP server.
    - **Monitoring and Error Tracking** Include simple logging and monitoring to track transfer errors and ensure smooth operations.
    - **Real-Time Updates** Use Websockets or similar to give real-time feedback on transfer progress.
